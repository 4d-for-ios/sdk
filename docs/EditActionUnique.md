> Not released, just a specification

- The purpose is to make any  task for an action with the preset `edit` to be unique :
  - If offline, an edit could be in pending task
  - If launch a new edit, intead of creating a new task, the one in pending task will be opened
    - so data already filled will be displayed 	

# Setting to activate the feature

##  MobileProject

> ðŸš§ how to inject inside mobile app for new projet? (have a boolean inside mobileapp file, and "4d mobile app" + android project generator must do the following edit

##  Android

Inside `app/src/main/assets/appInfo.json`

```json
	"action.editAreUnique": true
```

##  iOS

Inside `Settings/Settings.plist`

```xml
	<key>action.editAreUnique</key>
	<true/>
```

## If we want to go further

> :bulb: We could imagine have some definition by action, not only "edit" one. For that for instance a new boolean "isUnique" could be in the future added to the action json. 


## Naming

maybe rename unique to uniqueTask, action has unique task
