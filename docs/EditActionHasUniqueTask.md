#  EditActionHasUniqueTask

> [!CAUTION]
> Not released, just a specification

- The purpose is to make any task for an action with the `preset` key equal to `edit` to be unique :
  - If offline, an edit could be in pending task after validating the action form
  - If launch a new edit, instead of creating a new task, the one in pending task will be opened
    - so data already filled will be displayed
    - and when validating, just register the new data into selected/found task
	- no new task in pending task list
  	- waiting on network connection to send the data to server (inside on mobile app action)

# Setting to activate the feature

The feature is not for all, so a conf in 

##  MobileProject

maybe a key in mobile app project could be added, not mandatory, but useful if we want to generate new app with this feature, without the need to edit mobile project each time

> ðŸš§ how to inject inside mobile app for new projet? (have a boolean inside mobileapp file, and "4d mobile app" + android project generator must do the following edit

##  Android

Inside `app/src/main/assets/appInfo.json`

```json
	"action.edit.hasUniqueTask": true
```

##  iOS

Inside `Settings/Settings.plist`

```xml
	<key>action.edit.hasUniqueTask</key>
	<true/>
```

## If we want to go further

### for all type of action (doable quickly)

> :bulb: We could imagine have some definition by action, not only "edit" one. For that for instance a new boolean `hasUniqueTask` could be in the future added to the action json (or if we have time)

#### for iOS

in storyboards definition inside `userDefinedRuntimeAttribute`

#### for android

Inside `app/src/main/assets/actions.json` by action

#### allow to set action task unique in mobile project editor (will not do it)

adding for all in mobile project editor a way to edit project to set true or false by action
