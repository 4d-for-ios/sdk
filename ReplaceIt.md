# Replace a SDK

You could replace the iOS SDK in 4D.app by a zip archive with same format. For instance if the current SDK is not supported by a new Xcode version.

The path is  .../4D.app/Contents/Resources/Internal User Components/4D Mobile App.4dbase/Resources/sdk/Versions/1.0.zip

4D.app will be no more correctly signed, so you must allow the app to be run any anyway
